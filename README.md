# Exploration-in-RL
As of 5/8/20, new code for UC-MatrixRL as been updated to the VTR_Paper_Code/Fixed_UC_VTR_Matrix.ipynb. DO NOT use other UC_MatrixRL code as it has not been properly debugged. I only kept the buggy code in this repo for documentation purposes. Also a new folder VTR_Paper_Code contains the code used to generate the figures in our VTR paper (citation soon come). Run the code in the Fixed_UC_VTR_Matrix.ipynb and once the code has finished executing and the data has been saved, open the two different plot scripts to recreate the plots in our paper! Finally, the code for LSVI-UCB (Jin et al, 2019) has been updated! Now with better confidence bounds as well as the option for epsilon-greedy exploration. Reproducability sure is EXCITING ! 

As of 2/20/20, only PSRL, RLSVI, UCRL_VTR, and UC_MatrixRL have been properly debugged and optimized to run on the riverswim environment. UCBVI and LVSI_UCB still require further debugging but should run on RiverSwim on learn something.
